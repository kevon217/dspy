    "This notebook introduces a first attempt at a DSPy implementation of the \"Self-Discover\" approach, a novel method for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-compose reasoning structures for complex problem-solving tasks, as outlined in the paper [\"Self-Discover: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03620). By formulating Self-Discover as a DSPy program, we can enhance the LLM's ability to select, adapt, implement, and execute reasoning modules and structures dynamically.\n",
